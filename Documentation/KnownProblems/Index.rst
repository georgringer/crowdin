Where is the extension in the TYPO3 top bar
===========================================

If an extension does not appear on the Crowdin list in the TYPO3 top bar,
after you've installed it, it is probably because you need to update the language packs.
Head over to :guilabel:`ADMIN TOOLS > Maintenance > Manage Language Packs` and hit the
:guilabel:`Update all` button to get language packs for the newly installed extensions.


Find a list of `open issues on Github
<https://github.com/friendsoftypo3/crowdin/issues>`__.
